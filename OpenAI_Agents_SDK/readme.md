## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

- [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/)
- Python 3.12+
- Optional: [Chainlit](https://docs.chainlit.io) or Jupyter for hands-on demos

## 🔑 Tips

- Use `.env` to securely store API keys
- Use `Runner.run_sync()` for quick tests
- For tool-chaining, define proper `handoff_description` values
- Prefer strict schemas for safety; loosen them for flexibility when needed
